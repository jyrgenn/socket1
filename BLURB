This is release 1.3 of the Socket(1) program. This release is still
derived from 1.1, while 2.0 emerges very slowly.

Socket(1) implements an interface to TCP sockets at shell level.
Client and server sockets can be used from shell scripts or
interactively. Socket can also run a program with stdin, stdout, and
stderr connected to the socket connection. A number of sample shell
scripts is included. Socket-1.3 has been not tested thoroughly, but
should run on some Linuxes (well, pick your favourite distribution
and see if it runs), Solaris (8), and FreeBSD (4.7). It should be
not too hard to port to similar platforms.
