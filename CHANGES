Changes in Socket version 1.5

  - exit gracefully on SIGHUP

  by Boris Nikolaus:

  - -H option for half-close support of TCP connections

  - -Q option for TCP RESET on SIGINT and SIGTERM

  - IPv6 support added, -4 and -6 options for manual selection of
    protocol version

  - -h option for usage

  - a few bug fixes

  other changes:

  - build support for Interix (Microsoft Windows Services For Unix)

Changes in Socket version 1.4:

  - no more tab characters in the sources

  - support for building multiple architectures in one directory;
    requires GNU Make

  - -e option for not redirecting stderr of a called program to the
    socket, by Robert Lemmen

Changes in Socket version 1.3:

  - Fixed bug related to partial writes: always writing from the
    beginning of the block after partial writes caused data
    corruption after write(2) had been interrupted by a signal.

  - Fixed bug for 64-bit platforms: Change type of IP addresses from
    unsigned long to uint32_t.

  - Change of author e-mail address

  - -n option for not doing reverse lookups

  - -a bind-address option to bind the socket to a specific local IP
    address

  - socket address environment variables for child process

  - fixed bug with accept() and getpeername() addrlen argument type,
    which triggered a gcc warning

  - some minute documentation fixes

Changes in Socket version 1.2p1:

  - Fixed bug with incorrectly initialized SIGCHLD handler

  - ISOfied the remaining functions

  - Some other small style fixes

Changes in Socket version 1.2:

  - Adapted to Linux (in this case RH 5.2 with kernel 2.2.2), Solaris
    2.6 / 7, and FreeBSD 2.2.7. Other platforms are not (explicitly)
    supported by this release.

  - Except for SIGCHLD no signals are handled specially; siglist.c
    removed.

  - Multiple -vv options increase verbosity.

  - Sets SO_REUSEADDR unless -R option is specified.

  - Needs an ISO C compiler (and I hope it is not GCC dependent).

  - License changed to Berkeley-style.

  - Moved from ShapeTools to CVS (and a new repository -- that all
    source version numbers are 1.2 is *really* coincidental!)
