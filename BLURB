This is release 1.5 of the Socket(1) program. This release is still
derived from 1.1, while an attempt at a version 2 has been
abandoned.

Socket(1) implements an interface to TCP sockets at shell level,
reading from stdin and writing to stdout. Client and server sockets
can thus be used from shell scripts or interactively. Socket can
also run a program with stdin, stdout, and stderr connected to the
socket connection. A number of sample shell scripts is included.
Socket-1.5 has been not tested thoroughly, but should run on some
Linuxes (well, pick your favourite distribution and see if it runs),
Solaris (10), and FreeBSD (5 and following). It should be not too
hard to port to similar platforms.
