Changes in Socket version 1.2:

  - Adapted to Linux (in this case RH 5.2 with kernel 2.2.2), Solaris
    2.6 / 7, and FreeBSD 2.2.7. Other platforms are not (explicitly)
    supported by this release.

  - Except for SIGCHLD no signals are handled specially; siglist.c
    removed.

  - Multiple -vv options increase verbosity.

  - Needs an ISO C compiler.

  - License changed to Berkeley-style.
