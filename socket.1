.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Socket
creates an Internet domain TCP socket and connects it to stdin and stdout.
The 
.I host
argument can be an Internet number in dot-notation (like
``130.149.28.10'') or a domain name. In this case it must be possible
to resolve the name to a valid Internet address with
.IR gethostbyname (3).
The 
.I port
argument can be a port number or a service name which can be mapped to
a port number by
.IR getservbyname (3).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-a " bind-address
Bind the socket to the specified
.I bind-address
instead of the default address (in client mode) or all addresses of
the host (in server mode).
This may lead to a connection failure in client mode if there is no
route from the
.I bind-address
to the destination address.
.TP
.BR "\-4 " (IPv4)
Only use IP protocol version 4. (Default: Support both IPv4 and IPv6
if IPv6 support has been compiled in).
.TP
.BR "\-6 " (IPv6)
Only use IP protocol version 6 (if support has been compiled in).
(Default: Support both IPv4 and IPv6 if IPv6 support has been compiled
in).
.TP
.BR "\-b " (background)
The program forks itself into the background, detaches from its
controlling tty, closes the file descriptors associated with the tty,
and changes its current directory to the root directory.
.TP
.BR "\-c " (crlf)
Linefeed characters (LF) are converted to a Carriage Return Linefeed
sequence (CRLF) when written to the socket.
CRLF sequences read from the socket are converted to a single LF.
.TP
.BR "\-e " "(no stderr capture)"
With -p: stderr from the called program is not redirected to the
socket, but sent to the Socket program's original stderr.
.TP
.BR "\-f " (fork)
When a server connection has been accepted, a separate process is
forked to handle the connection in background.
.TP
.BR "\-h " (help)
Display the usage of the program.
.TP
.BR "\-H " (half-close)
Enable half-close support. This allows to close both directions of the
connection separately by sending an end-of-file indicator for each
direction. The connection is assumed alive until both directions have
been closed.
.TP
.BR "\-l " (loop)
(only valid with
.BR \-s )
After a connection has been closed,
another connection is accepted.
.TP 
.BR "\-n " "(no reverse lookup)"
Don't do reverse lookup of peer addresses.
.TP
.BR "\-p " (program)
The specified 
.I command
is executed for each connection. Its standard input, standard output,
and standard error channels are connected to the socket.
The environment variables SOCKET_LOCAL_ADDRESS and SOCKET_LOCAL_PORT
are set to the socket's local IP address and port number; the
environment variables SOCKET_PEER_ADDRESS and SOCKET_PEER_PORT are
correspondingly set to IP address and port number of the socket on
the peer's side.
.I Command
can be any shell command since it is passed to \fC/bin/sh\fP for
execution.
.TP
.BR "\-q " (quit)
The connection is closed when an end-of-file condition occurs on standard
input.
.TP
.BR "\-Q " "(reset on ungraceful quit)"
When the program is terminated by SIGINT or SIGTERM or if reading from
stdin or writing to stdout fails, the connection is closed
ungracefully by sending a TCP RESET instead of TCP FIN. This allows to
detect the abortion at the remote side where
.IR read (2)
returns a "Connection reset by peer" error.
.TP
.BR "\-r " "(read only)"
No data is read from standard input and written to the socket.
.TP
.BR "\-R " "(no REUSEADDR)"
Don't set the socket option SO_REUSEADDR.
.TP
.BR "\-s " (server)
A server socket is created.
A
.I hostname 
argument is not required.
.TP
.BR "\-T " (timeout)
The specified
.I timeout
(in seconds) is applied to the
.IR connect (2)
and
.IR select (2)
system calls, such that the program is terminated when that timeout
expires on connection setup or when reading from the socket or
standard input.
.TP
.BR "\-v " (verbose)
Each ``v'' in the options increases the verbosity level by one.
Currently supported are 
.BR 1 :
print information about connections, and 
.BR 2 :
additionally print information about name resolution and connection
attempts.
.TP
.BR "\-w " "(write only)"
No data is read from the socket and written to the standard output.
.TP
.B \-version
.B Socket
prints its version ID and terminates. 
This must be the first argument to have an effect.
.SH EXAMPLES
The command
.IP
\fCsocket -v coma.cs.tu-berlin.de nntp\fP
.LP
connects to the nntp port (port 119) of coma.cs.tu-berlin.de
(130.149.28.10).
.br
The command
.IP
\fCsocket \-sl 3425\fP
.LP
creates a server socket on port 3425 on the local host and waits for a
connection.
After a connection has been closed, a new connection is accepted. 
.br
The command
.IP
\fCsocket \-wslqvp "echo Socket! " 1938\fP
.LP
creates a server socket on port 1938 on the local host and waits for a
connection. When a connection is accepted, the string "Socket!" is
written to the socket. No data is read from the socket and written to
the \fCfinger\fP program. The connection is closed when an end-of-file
condition at the standard output of the program occurs. Then a new
connection is accepted.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Lots of diagnostics for failed system calls.
.TP
.BI "unknown host " host
.IR host 's
address could not be resolved.
.B socket
terminates due to an error condition.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR accept (2),
.BR bind (2),
.BR connect (2), 
.BR listen (2), 
.BR socket (2),
.BR getaddrinfo (3),
.BR gethostbyname (3),
.BR getservbyname (3)
.SH BUGS
The version 2 release is overdue.
.LP
\fCsocket \-p\fP terminates due to a SIGPIPE signal if there is more
data from the socket available than the child process wants to read.
.LP
Please report any other bugs to the author.
