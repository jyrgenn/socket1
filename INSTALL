To install Socket-1.3, the Makefile needs some editing. Instructions
are included near the beginning of the Makefile. Edit as necessary and
type "make install". This builds the program and installs the
executable as /usr/local/bin/socket and the manual page as
/usr/local/man/man1/socket.1.

Socket relies on some Berkeleyisms and POSIXisms in signal, process,
and IO handling, so porting it to (other) non-BSD-derived platforms
may be difficult. I am interested in any changes you make to port the
program to a new platform. Please send them back to me so I can merge
them into a later release.
