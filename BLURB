This is interim release 1.2 of the Socket(1) program.

Socket(1) implements an interface to TCP sockets at shell level.
Client and server sockets can be used from shell scripts or
interactively. Socket can also run a program with stdin, stdout, and
stderr connected to the socket connection. A number of sample shell
scripts is included. Socket-1.2 has been tested on Linux (RH 5.2 with
2.2.2 kernel), Solaris (2.6 and 7), and FreeBSD (2.2.7). It should be
easy to port to similar platforms.
