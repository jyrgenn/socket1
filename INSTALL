The Makefile is for GNU Make; if you use another make program, you
will need to make some changes to the Makefile.

The Makefile needs some editing anyway. Instructions are included
near the beginning of the Makefile. Edit as necessary and type "make
install". This builds the program and installs the executable as
/usr/local/bin/socket and the manual page as /usr/local/man/man1/socket.1.

Socket relies on some Berkeleyisms and POSIXisms in signal, process,
and IO handling, so porting it to (other) non-BSD-derived platforms
may be difficult. I am interested in any changes you make to port the
program to a new platform. Please send them back to me so I can merge
them into a later release.
